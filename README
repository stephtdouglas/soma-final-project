My final project for the "Statistics, Observations, and Modeling in Astronomy" graduate seminar, taught by David Schiminovich at Columbia University.  

My goals for this project were:

1) to teach myself a couple different methods for time-series analysis

2) to see how well rotation periods for stars can be determined using high-cadence but short-baseline data (a single Kepler quarter), as opposed to high-cadence and long-baseline data (4 Kepler quarters, the results from McQuillan et al. 2013).  I wanted to do this in anticipation of K2 observations, which will provide only about 75 days of data on many stars around the sky.

3) to see how well rotation periods for stars can be determined using long-baseline but unevenly sampled data (ground-based surveys like PTF), again as opposed to the high-cadence and long-baseline results from Kepler presented in McQuillan et al. (2013)


Broadly speaking, my results for these three goals are most easily seen in:

1) time_series.py
